	\maketitle
	
	This document contains citations for all of the entries included in the main \hologo{BibTeX} file of this repository: \textit{Bleaman\_bibliography.bib}. The citations are formatted in accordance with the ``Unified Style Sheet for Linguistics,'' which was prepared in 2006 by the Linguistic Society of America's Committee of Editors of Linguistics Journals.\footnote{The style sheet is available inside the repo (\textit{USS.pdf}) or on the LSA website: \url{https://www.linguisticsociety.org/celxj}.} Wherever possible, a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) link is provided.
	
	This bibliography is likely to be useful to sociolinguists and anybody whose language interests overlap with mine (especially Yiddish). The \textit{.bib} file contains a field for keywords, which may aid in finding appropriate references. I have PDF copies of many of these sources, so feel free to reach out if you are having difficulty tracking down a reference.
